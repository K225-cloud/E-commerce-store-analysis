Here is a new real-time project on Data analysis of an E-commerce store based in India.
Profit and loss are part of the business but if you don't know about your losses it's a dangerous sign of it.
Through this project, I got to learn many things about customer behaviour and what they like to buy regularly.
according to this data from E-commerce store people are spending more towards their clothes than on electronics or anything else.
learning in this project-
1. how to create a more interactive dashboard
2. Choosing right data on X-Axis &Y-Axis
